US	32158956	R1KKOXHNI8MSXU	B01KL6O72Y	24485154	Easy Tool Stainless Steel Fruit Pineapple Corer Slicer Peeler Cut (One size, sliver)	Apparel	4	0	0	N	Y	★ THESE REALLY DO WORK GREAT WITH SOME TWEAKING ★	These Really Do Work Great, But You Do Need To Know a Few Things.  I've Been Using Mine For a Few Years Now.  First, I Paid a Few Dollars Less For Mine and The Price Has Jumped.  They're All Imported, so Try to Find Either a Cheaper One or One That's Extremely Well Made.  This One is Made Well Enough, If You're Careful.  This Thing Can Cut You, So Don't Let Some Kid Use It, &#34;Because It Looks Like Fun!!&#34;  You Need A Pineapple That's Big Enough.  I Can't Tell You How Many Times I Went to Wal-Mart or the Grocery Store and Their Pineapples were Just Too Small of a Diameter.  It HAS to Be Big Enough.  It's Better To Have Some Waste on The Inside Of The Husk.<br /><br />When I'm Finished Using The Pineapple Corer, Then I Cut Up the Husk Of The Pineapple To Get The Rest Of The Pineapple Cut Up and I Save The Core of the Pineapple To Go Into My Iced Tea Pitcher or Drink Pitcher (That's How They Do It In Hawaii)  When I Was In Hawaii, They Never Threw Away The Core, They Always Used It For Something.  Sometimes, They Even Grilled It, Although I've Never Tried That.  But, I Know They Did It With Honey and Some Kind of Teriyaki  People Have Also Left Chunks of Pineapple on the Husk and Grilled it Meat Side Down on the Grill.  Then, They Eat The Chunks of Grilled Pineapple and Use The Husks Like a Little Bowl..  You Don't Grill The Husk Part.  You Can Also Keep The Husk Whole, Like a Bowl and Take the Center Core Out, Then Fill It Full Of Fruit Salad or Use it as a Drink Container or Dessert Container.<br /><br />Someone Told Me They Like To Make Pineapple Greek Yogurt and Fill It, Then Freeze It a Short Time.  I've Never Tried That.  I've Made Pineapple Cheesecake and That's Delicious, but I Know It's Tricky Working With Pineapple Sometimes.  You Know, If You've Ever Tried to Make Jello & Put Pineapple In.  YIKES!!! The Bromelain in the Pineapple Keeps Your Gelatin From Setting.  It is a Great Anti-Inflammatory & Helps Your Digestive Tract & Tummy Feel Better, But That Same Enzyme Interferes with Your Jello Setting Up.<br /><br />When Washing These, Be Extra Carful and Wash Them Separate.  I Use Tooth Picks, to Get the Pineapple Out That Gets Stuck In The Little Crevices.  I Always Put The Parts Back Into The Box & Make Sure Everything is Dry.  So, That's It.  Make Sure Your Pineapple is Big Enough.  Get All Your Pineapple To Work For You.  Clean Your Corer and Protect Your Hands.  That's It.
