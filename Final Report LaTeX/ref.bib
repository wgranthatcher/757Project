	abstract={Online customer reviews are a sustainable form of word of mouth (WOM) which play an increasingly important role in e-commerce. However, low quality reviews can often cause inconvenience to review readers. The purpose of this paper is to automatically predict the helpfulness of reviews. This paper analyzes the characteristics embedded in product reviews across five different product types and explores their effects on review helpfulness. Furthermore, four data mining methods were examined to determine the one that best predicts review helpfulness for each product type using five real-life review datasets obtained from Amazon.com. The results show that reviews for different product types have different psychological and linguistic characteristics and the factors affecting the review helpfulness of them are also different. Our findings also indicate that the support vector regression method predicts review helpfulness most accurately among the four methods for all five datasets. This study contributes to improving efficient utilization of online reviews.},
